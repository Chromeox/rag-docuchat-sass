## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Deploy your demo first** - You need a working demo regardless of path
2. **Start small** - Get one client before trying to scale
3. **Service businesses** are easiest first clients (law, consulting, real estate)
4. **Lead with the demo** - Live demo converts 10x better than slides
5. **Network first** - Your first clients should be warm leads
6. **Document everything** - Reuse deployment scripts for speed
7. **Charge upfront** - $1,500 before deployment starts
