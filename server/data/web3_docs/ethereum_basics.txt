Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which are self-executing programs stored on the blockchain. These contracts run exactly as programmed without downtime or interference.

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.
