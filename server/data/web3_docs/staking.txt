Staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network.

In Ethereum, staking involves depositing ETH to become a validator. Validators help secure the network by validating transactions and proposing new blocks.

In return, validators earn rewards in ETH. Staking replaced mining when Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake.
