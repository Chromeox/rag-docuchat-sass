RAG DocuChat Sample Document

This is a sample document for testing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

Key Features:
- Document upload and storage
- Text embedding generation using HuggingFace transformers
- FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search
- Context retrieval for enhanced LLM responses

Technology Stack:
- FastAPI for backend API
- LangChain for RAG orchestration
- HuggingFace sentence-transformers for embeddings
- FAISS for vector storage and retrieval
- Groq/OpenAI for LLM inference

The system allows users to upload documents, which are then processed into chunks, embedded into vector space, and stored in a FAISS index. When users ask questions, relevant context is retrieved from the vector store and provided to the LLM to generate accurate, context-aware responses.
